/**
 * This ISA instruction is the bread and butter for synchronizing the current tile with an arbitrary subset of 
 * other tiles in the MAGIA mesh. The functionality of this instruction is NOT easy to understand or correctly 
 * utilize, it is heavily recomended to avoid directly using this instruction and instead use the API wrappers  
 * hiding this behemoth.
 * 
 * But if you insist to use it for your little, special experiment, then be my fucking guest.
 * 
 * ID and AGGREGATE are the two values that guide the entire synchronization process.
 * 
 * Starting from the tile this instruction is called, the fractal sync tree is explored in reverse order, towards 
 * the root node.
 * 
 * If ID is even (or zero), the HORIZONTAL tree is explored. If ID is odd, the VERTICAL tree is explored.
 * 
 * The number of nodes traversed is equal to the number of significant bits passed in the AGGREGATE value. 
 * In fact, you should always pass AGGREGATE as a bit string to know what you are exactly doing. (I.E. 0b110)
 * 
 * The MSB is the highest level explored, the LSB is the lowest.
 * 
 * If there is at least one tile you want to synchronize with, which visible from a certain level, you should put 1 in 
 * the bit associated for that level. Instead, if there are no tiles you have to synchronize with in a certain 
 * level THAT YOU HAVEN'T SYNCHRONIZED WITH IN A PREVIOUS ONE, then you put 0 in its associated bit.
 * 
 * If you mess up and put 1 in a level in which there are no other tiles to synchronize with, 
 * or in which there are only tiles you already synchronized in a previous level, you are in Deadlock City baby. 
 * 
 * Told you to use the fucking APIs!
 * 
 * If the AGGREGATE value is EXACTLY 1, then a special behavior is activated. 
 * 
 * Depending on the ID value, the current tile will synchronize with:
 * 
 * ID == 0 : The tile at synchronization level 0 in the horizontal fsync tree
 * ID == 1 : The tile at synchronization level 0 in the vertical fsync tree
 * ID == 2 : The tile horizontally neighboring NOT visible at synch level 0 in the horizontal fsync tree
 * ID == 3 : The tile vertically neighboring NOT visible at synch level 0 in the vertical fsync tree
 * 
 * If you have no fucking clue on what you just read means, then I'm sorry but you are not in the right place.
 * Try the MAGIA repository README file!
 * 
 * There is more! The ID value, in fact, isn't just used to decide whether we explore the horizontal or vertical
 * tree. In fact, through a single synchronization tree node there might be multiple fsync calls going through in
 * parallel at the same time. 
 * 
 * To avoid collisions, multiple barriers are set up for each node, the one on which the instruction waits is 
 * chosen by the ID value.
 * 
 * It's up to YOU to make sure that the tiles that are synchronizing are calling the fsync over the same barrier ID.
 * 
 * Unfortunately, you can't choose whichever ID you want. There is a physical ID limit equal to:
 * 
 * - For the horizontal fsync tree: 2 * ((2^L) - 1)
 * - For the vertical fsync tree: 2 * ((2^L) - 1) + 1
 * - For the nodes that are in both fsync trees: ((2^L) - 1)
 * 
 * Where L is the level of the MSB in the AGGREGATE value. This means that you must have a solid idea of the 
 * nature of the highest node you are synchronizing with. And of the fsync map, in general. If you mess up, you're screwed.
 * 
 * I'd gladly write down some examples, but my ASCII art skills are dogshit, so instead just open the APIs and
 * take a look on how it is possible to do stuff like synchronizing specific rows, columns, diagnolas, the outer
 * ring, and from there you should have a rough idea on how to do this.
 * 
 * Maybe.
 * 
 * Good luck!
